# Mip Map generation using NVIDIA NPP with CUDA

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of NVIDIA Performance Primitives (NPP) library with CUDA to perform image resizing and combination of different sizes in order to create a mip map. The goal is to utilize GPU acceleration to create a mip map image which can be used by rendering libraries such as Vulkan, D3D12 etc... Project leverages the computational power of modern GPUs. The project is a part of the CUDA at Scale for the Enterprise course and serves as a template for understanding how to implement basic image processing operations using CUDA and NPP.

Project is WINDOWS ONLY.

## Code Organization

```x64/```
This folder should hold all binary/executable code that is built automatically or manually. Executable code should have use the .exe extension or programming language-specific extension.

```data/```
This folder should hold all example data in any format. If the original data is rather large or can be brought in via scripts, this can be left blank in the respository, so that it doesn't require major downloads when all that is desired is the code/structure.

```vendor/```
Any libraries that are not installed via the Operating System-specific package manager should be placed here, so that it is easier for inclusion/linking.

```src/```
The source code should be placed here in a hierarchical fashion, as appropriate.

```README.md```
This file should hold the description of the project so that anyone cloning or deciding if they want to clone this repository can understand its purpose to help with their decision.

```INSTALL```
This file should hold the human-readable set of instructions for installing the code so that it can be executed. If possible it should be organized around different operating systems, so that it can be done by as many people as possible with different constraints.

## Supported OSes

Windows

## Supported CPU Architecture

x86_64, ppc64le, armv7l

## CUDA APIs involved

## Dependencies needed to build/run
[FreeImage](../../README.md#freeimage), [NPP](../../README.md#npp)

## Prerequisites

Download and install the [CUDA Toolkit 11.4](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) for your corresponding platform.
Make sure the dependencies mentioned in [Dependencies]() section above are installed.

## Build and Run

### Windows
The Windows samples are built using the Visual Studio IDE. Solution files (.sln) are provided for each supported version of Visual Studio, using the format:
```
*_vs<version>.sln - for Visual Studio <version>
```
Each individual sample has its own set of solution files in its directory:

To build/examine all the samples at once, the complete solution files should be used. To build/examine a single sample, the individual sample solution files should be used.
> **Note:** Some samples require that the Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010 or newer) be installed and that the VC++ directory paths are properly set up (**Tools > Options...**). Check DirectX Dependencies section for details."

## Running the Program
After building the project, you can run the program using the following command:

```bash
Copy code
make run
```

This command will execute the compiled binary, generatign mip map for (Lena.png), and save the result as Lena_rotated.png in the data/ directory. Please **note** that data directory will be copied inside of build folder. So {architecture}/{build_type}/data, ie. x64/Release/data. 

If you wish to run the binary directly with custom input/output files, you can use:

```bash
- Copy code - or ./x64/Release 
./x64/Debug --input data/Lena.png --output data/Lena_rotated.png
```
